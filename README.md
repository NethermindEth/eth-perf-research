# Ethereum Performance Benchmarking

This repository hosts infrastructure, tooling, and research focused on benchmarking Ethereum client performance under varying gas limits and state sizes. The goal is to enable safe, data-driven protocol tuning and provide actionable insights for the Ethereum ecosystem.

## 🌐 Project Scope

- **Gas Limit Analysis**  
  Evaluate Ethereum mainnet performance under varying gas limits. Recommend a safe, optimized gas limit based on real data and a public checklist.

- **State Bloat Research**  
  Assess the performance impact of large state sizes (e.g. 10× mainnet) across clients and scenarios. Establish whether state growth meaningfully affects throughput and block processing.

- **Infrastructure & Coordination**  
  - Maintain advanced Perfnet and Blobs-only Perfnet networks  
  - Provide reproducible benchmarking environments  
  - Ensure coordination across Execution and Consensus Layer teams  
  - Public dashboards and transparent metrics

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

- Safe gas limit recommendation for mainnet adoption  
- Publicly available benchmarks and performance data  
- Clear checklist for evaluating protocol changes  
- Streamlined collaboration across clients  
- Transparent and trackable process for EL/CL teams

## 🧠 Who Is This For?

- Ethereum client developers (EL and CL)  
- Core protocol researchers  
- Infra engineers and performance analysts  
- Ethereum community members interested in network scalability
